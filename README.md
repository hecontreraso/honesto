# Honesto app

My focus for this app was to give the client a POC that he could use to interact with. With this objective in mind, I tried to deliver as much as I could, removing unnecesary screens and some business logic. That's why google auth, the placeholder screens, the 404 screens and some other non-critical parts are not implemented.

### What stuff I couldn't complete on time?

I finished everything I promised. I took aproximately ~17-18 hours (sorry about that!)

### What things would I have done differently with 1 week instead of just 2 days?

As we are in an scenario where the client wants to have an actual demo before deciding if he wants to continue with the idea or not, I think I wouldn't have done things differently. For example, I could say I would implement a lot of more things, state management, auth, testing, error reporting, etc.

But in that case, we have a risk: the client can say "hey I used the app and I decided that I don't want to continue with this idea". That would mean that I wasted a lot of time coding that stuff. But once we got the green light to continue, then all of those things would make sense.

Maybe there's one thing I would have done different: to code this in ~1 more days, so I don't feel pressured and that I have to rush to deliver.
